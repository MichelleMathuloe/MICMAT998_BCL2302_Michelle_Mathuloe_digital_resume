                <h3>Impala Platinum Mines</h3>
                <p>I worked as a contractor in the Covid-response team where I was a Project Administrator. My duties
                    were,
                    but not limited to, ensuring that every mine employee
                    and their next of kins received the proper care when diagnosed with Covid-19 or risked the exposure
                    to
                    it. I had to ensure that the clerks completed all
                    the paperwork and gave food parcels to all who were affected. I worked closely with the healthcare
                    professionals as well as the Project Manager, so as to ensure timeous reporting.
